# Resourcing

Overall, the following types of resourcing will need to be considered:

1. Availability of suitably qualified team mentors / tutors
2. Staff resource for lecturing and other contact hours
3. Funding for mentors and lab demonstrators

However in this document, we focus on (1).

For Year 1, we make the following assumptions:

* enrollment will be capped at 40
* there will be approximately eight teams of students for the project coursework
* four mentors would suffice, with each mentor devoting one hour per week to two teams

To ensure sufficient interdisciplinary spread without extending too far, we would like to have around four or five schools involved as 'premium' partners in the course. This would make it possible to constrain the task of timetabling, and also allow a collaborative network to be built. 

Discussion so far suggests that scarcity of PhD students who are willing and able to serve as tutors affects schools other than Informatics. However, in the short term, identifying four suitably qualified mentors should be feasible. 

Looking ahead, we would like to investigate the possibility of training up a pool of UG4 students who would be able to take on a mentoring role. Such students seem to be available within Informatics and Geosciences, and probably other schools as well.
