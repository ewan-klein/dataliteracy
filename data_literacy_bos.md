## Case for support



### Overall contribution to teaching portfolio

This course asks how data and design can be combined to support social innovation. It focusses the question through the lens of developing prototype solutions for 'real life' problems that require an interdisciplinary approach founded on collecting, interpreting and presenting data. 

One of the key drivers for the course is the University’s [Emerging Vision for Learning and Teaching](http://www.docs.sasg.ed.ac.uk/AcademicServices/Projects/Consultation%20on%20University%20Vision%20for%20Learning%20and%20Teaching%20Aug%202014.pdf). The vision includes the following goals:

**Extend learning beyond the traditional knowledge-centred course** &mdash; use the length and credit-pattern of our degrees to facilitate time spent developing graduate attributes through, for example, credit bearing self-directed study, international or service experience, interaction with employers, entrepreneurship.</li>

**Every student a researcher/practitioner** &mdash; students are linked to research or practice groups and activities from year 1.

**Course design for 21st century learners** &mdash; develop all courses within the curriculum towards the appropriate use of technology and student-centred pedagogy and away from passive learning styles. An ongoing focus on small group interactions with academics will be key to this, with a reduced emphasis on the ‘traditional’ lecture/ closed exam model of teaching.

The following features of the proposed course will support these goals:

1. Students will address problems which arise locally (in either the University or the city) and in so doing will engage with organisations and problem-holders outside the classroom. 
2. By requiring students to carry out a substantial group project, the course is strongly practice-based. Within the frame of reference provided the project specification, students will have considerable freedom to develop their own approaches. In addition, the projects will be structured so as to introduce students to basic research methodology.
3. Projects will be carried out in small interdisciplinary teams. This will provide rich opportunities for peer-support and joint problem-solving. Project teams will be an important functional unit for interacting with course academics and tutors.

Together, these features contribute strongly towards helping students develop graduate attributes, encourage them to adopt researcher/practioner roles, and support a strongly engaged and active learning style.

<!--
* the knowledge-based learning outcomes will be consolidated and contextualised by practice-based work, most importantly in a substantial, team-based project;
* the interdisciplinary orientation will prepare students for the world of work beyond the university;

In order to underpin the interdisciplinary approach to learning, we will strongly encourage other departments to become stakeholders. The

The course is intended to be open to students all students, including those from Informatics. In addition to the benefits noted above, the course will complement the existing pre-Honours curriculum in important respects:

* Many Informatics students have strong technical and analytic skills, but lack practice and facility in expressing themselves coherently and persuasively in writing. The course will require all students to write two reports, the first of which will be formatively assessed.
* Many Informatics students are capable of building complex and sophisticated software 'apps', but have little or no ability to understand how such software would address real user needs. The course will encourage students to think about user-centre design and will encourage rapid prototyping using co-design techniques.


<!--
The course contributes to the following initiatives:

*   
* The [Edinburgh2020](http://edinburgh2020.org) platform for
  innovation and re-thinking education within the University; 
*  The
    [Edinburgh Living Lab](http://edinburghlivinglab.org) collaboration between the University and City of Edinburgh Council; 
*   [Edinburgh Data Science](http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/data-science).
-->

### Target audience and expected demand


The approach adopted by the course embodies important components of the Smart Data Hack, which is now being run for the third time. Over the course of the last three years, the Smart Data Hack has proved to be enormously popular amongst Informatics students and is also increasing its reach to other Schools, including Biology, Business, Engineering, ECA, Maths, Physics, PPL and SPS. On this basis, there is reason to believe that the course will appeal widely to students across the University. 

It is also worth noting that the proposed course aligns well with the priorities of student-led initiatives such as [Edinburgh2020](http://edinburgh2020.org) and the [Buchanan Institute](http://buchananinst.org).

### Relation to existing curriculum

The course would be optional for Informatics 1, but like the core courses, would contribute to the broad base of learning which is deepened and extended through the following three years of Informatics degrees. 





### Resources

In order to fulfil the interdisciplinary goals of the course, around 50% of the teaching effort should come from outside the School of Informatics. 

We will bid for this course to be supported as a case study / pilot for the *Emerging Vision for Learning and Teaching*. We cannot pretend to be able to foresee how cross-School resourcing will be found on a sustainable basis, but believe that in this period of radical change in the University's approach to the curriculum, it is sensible to adopt an approach of rapid prototyping and iterative development in order support innovation in teaching and learning.

This proposal follows on from a pilot in the Masters-level Design for
Informatics course last semester that implemented key ideas from the
Living Lab movement and from the Learning by Developing model of
pedagogy.  Students were provided with a grounding in basic data
concepts, and engaged in a 4-week project on the theme of Active
Travel in collaboration with Inverleith Neighbourhood Partnership. The
results of the pilot were disseminated in a workshop to University
colleagues from across the spectrum of subject areas. The workshop
demonstrated that there is considerable interest in, and support for,
this kind of  innovation from many parts of the University.

The pilot was the basis for a succesful bid to the Principal’s
Teaching Award Scheme, and this will provide financial support for developing many of the teaching materials required for this course.

## Course Materials

**Sample coursework specification**

Waste management is an important element in the University’s
sustainability strategy. The overarching priority is to reduce the
volume of waste overall, and within that, to reduce the proportion of
waste the goes to landfill. The University has adoped a number of
measures for reaching these objectives, but there is plenty of scope
for extending and improving them. Waste management can be analysed at
both the macro and the micro level. Take paper towels. How many in
total are purchased, how do they ‘flow’ and get aggregated through the
overall University waste collection system, where are they collected
by the external waste contractor and where do they eventually end up?
At the micro level, what influences the decision of an individual to
use a paper towel (or two, or three) to clean her coffee cup?

**Assignment 1**: In your team, carry out a lightning investigation into some aspect of waste managment in the University over the course of a single week. What data is available? What issues can you discover What new data might you collect to get a better picture of the current
situation. Your team will be expected to give a 10 minute presentation, with slides, of your initial findings.

[not summatively assessed]

**Assignment 2**: On the basis your first lightning investigation, plan
and implement a small project in which your team designs an
‘intervention’ which would help address some problem of waste
management. In the course of your project, you will be expected to
collect three distinct types of new data in order to gain better insight into the problem; these should consist of

1. at least one existing data set, preferably published under an open licence;
2. survey or participative workshop data;
3. automatically recorded data, for example GPS, video or sensor data.

You should analyse this new data, see how it can be combined, and investigate whether what you have discovered can be used to justify new ways of dealing with waste.

* You will produce an individual report which describes your project,
    explains your specific role in the work, and presents your team’s
    conclusions. The submission should include (a pointer to) all data
    that you have collected.
* You will contribute to a final project presentation, which will
    include slides and any accompaning materials.

## Course Management

### Feedback

### Management of teaching delivery

In order to meet the interdisciplinary goals of this course, teaching resource needs to be provided from more than one school. ???

The projects are a key component of the course. To function effectively, they must involve challenges that meet the following conditons:

* they involve 'real life' problems which are manifested locally in Edinburgh communities;
* they offer technical challenges to a range of disciplines that are taught at undergraduate level in the University;
* there is scope for design-led intervention by student teams, based on collection, analysis, interpretation and presentation of data;
* the course organiser has, or is able to establish, working relationships with external organisations acting as 'problem stakeholders'. 

ECCI is uniquely positioned to act to broker such challenges, and has agreed to act as a partner for this course.
