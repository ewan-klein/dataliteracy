# New Course: Data Literacy

Summary
=======

This course resembles Informatics Literacy in several respects:

* It is a 20 pt Level 7 course;
* it is generalist in approach


that it contributes to the following initiatives:

*   The University’s [Emerging Vision for Learning and Teaching](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.docs.sasg.ed.ac.uk%2FAcademicServices%2FProjects%2FConsultation%2520on%2520University%2520Vision%2520for%2520Learning%2520and%2520Teaching%2520Aug%25202014.pdf&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNG-kunRT4WrQ4xuJeFkVhhmVDv7Ug);
*   The [Edinburgh2020](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fedinburgh2020.org&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEb8WL0VdC9UZxddV9ANhejbEITcQ) platform for innovation and re-thinking education within the University;
*   The [Edinburgh Living Lab](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fedinburghlivinglab.org&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFJyi8dg8PKTFMV--nGsZtuCQ_KdA) collaboration between the University and City of Edinburgh Council;
*   [Edinburgh Data Science](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ed.ac.uk%2Fschools-departments%2Fdata-science&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHRWpOit51p4BnzpckEeU6dtCS-8Q).

The main changes proposed are:

*   retitle the course Data Literacy;
*   modify the course description;
*   re-orient the intended learning outcomes;
*   adopt a ‘learning by developing’ model of pedagogy;
*   assess the course by a combination of assessed assignments and oral presentation.

Data literacy is a key transferrable skill, and it is fitting that the School of Informatics should take a lead role in introducing the topic into the undergraduate curriculum. At the same time, the proposed course would place an emphasis on interdisciplinary teamwork, and to underpin this, we would strongly encourage other departments to become stakeholders in this initiative.

Data Literacy
=============

Course Description
------------------

Data plays a pervasive role in modern society: we are all consumers and producers of data on a daily basis. Moreover, data is increasingly important for all aspects of academic endeavour.  By becoming data literate—understanding how data is collected, how it can be interpreted, and how it functions in social and political processes—you will be better prepared for your undergraduate studies, for your future career, and for becoming an informed citizen. This course will provide you with basic concepts and tools for understanding data, but just as importantly, it gives you an opportunity to acquire a practice-based understanding of data by contributing to a team-based interdisciplinary project.  Your team will address an existing social challenge by collecting, processing and analysing data as part of designing a solution.

of Intended Learning Outcomes

Summary of Intended Learning Outcomes
-------------------------------------

1.  Demonstrate a knowledge of different types of data, and how such data is collected.
2.  Demonstrate a knowledge of basic data analysis techniques.
3.  Demonstrate an understanding of the principles for communicating information that arises from data.
4.  Demonstrate an understanding of the way that data accrues value in the context of modern society.
5.  Demonstrate an understanding of the basic legal and ethical issues that arise from data collection and data use.
6.  Carry out at least two forms of data collection in a manner that respects legal and ethical considerations.
7.  Interpret and evaluate data relative to specific communication / policy objectives.
8.  Implement, evaluate and document a prototype 'intervention' relative to the interests and needs of a specified community of stakeholders.
9.  Communicate the information in two or more datasets using appropriate analytic, presentation and visualisation techniques.
10. Plan and implement a small group project, demonstrating an ability to work in an interdisciplinary team.
11. Act in a professional manner in interactions with stakeholders and the public.

Example Project Theme
---------------------

Waste management is an important element in the University’s sustainability strategy. The overarching priority is to produce the volume of waste overall, and within that, to reduce the proportion of waste the goes to landfill. The University has adoped a number of measures for reaching these objectives, but there is plenty of scope for extending and improving them. Waste management can be analysed at both the macro and the micro level. Take paper towels. How many in total are purchased, how do they ‘flow’ and get aggregated through the overall University waste collection system, where are they collected by the external waste contractor and where do they eventually end up? At the micro level, what influences the decision of an individual to use a paper towel (or two, or three) to clean her coffee cup?

Assignment 1: In your team, carry out a lightning investigation into some aspect of waste managment in the University over the course of a single week. What data is available? What issues can you discover? What new data might you collect to get a better picture of the current situation. Your team will be expected to give a 10 minute presentation, with slides, of your initial findings.

[not summatively assessed]

Assignment 2: On the basis your first lightning investigation, plan and implement a small project in which your team designs an ‘intervention’ which would help address some problem of waste management. In the course of your project, you will be expected to collect new data in order to gain better insight into the problem. You should analyse this new data, see how it can be combined with other available data, and investigate whether what you have found can be used to justify new ways of dealing with waste.

-   You will produce an individual report which describes your project, explains your specific role in the work, and presents your team’s conclusions. The submission should include (a pointer to) all data that you have collected.
-   You will contribute to a final project presentation, which will include slides and any accompaning materials.

Background
==========

This proposal follows on from a pilot in the Masters-level Design for Informatics course last semester that implemented key ideas from the Living Lab movement and from the Learning by Developing model of pedagogy.  Students were provided with a grounding in basic data concepts, and engaged in a 4-week project on the theme of Active Travel in collaboration with Inverleith Neighbourhood Partnership. The results of the pilot were disseminated in a workshop to University colleagues from across the spectrum of subject areas. The workshop demonstrated that there is considerable interest in, and support for, this kind of teaching innovation from many parts of the University.

The pilot was the basis for a succesful bid to the Principal’s Teaching Award Scheme, and this will provide financial support for the applicants to consolidate and extend the methods and teaching resources for future deployments of the approach to Design for Informatics and potentially for other courses.
