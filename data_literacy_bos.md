# New Course: Data Literacy

## Summary

Data literacy is a key transferrable skill, and it is fitting that the
School of Informatics should take a lead role in introducing the topic
into the undergraduate curriculum. The proposed course resembles [Informatics Literacy](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/il1/) in a couple of respects: it
is a 20 pt Level 7 course; it is generalist in approach, and will be
offered as an outside course to other programmes. However, it also has several distinctive features:

* the knowledge-based learning outcomes will be consolidated and contextualised by practice-based work, most importantly in a substantial, team-based project;
* the interdisciplinary orientation will prepare students for the world of work beyond the university;
* students will be expected to engage actively and responsibly with problems and problem-holders outside the classroom.

In order to underpin the interdisciplinary approach to learning, we will strongly encourage other departments to become stakeholders. The course is intended to be open to students from Informatics, and will offer them information, skills and ways of learning that are not currently available elsewhere in the curriculum.

The course contributes to the following initiatives:

*   The University’s [Emerging Vision for Learning and Teaching](http://www.docs.sasg.ed.ac.uk/AcademicServices/Projects/Consultation%20on%20University%20Vision%20for%20Learning%20and%20Teaching%20Aug%202014.pdf);
* The [Edinburgh2020](http://edinburgh2020.org) platform for
  innovation and re-thinking education within the University; 
*  The
    [Edinburgh Living Lab](http://edinburghlivinglab.org) collaboration between the University and City of Edinburgh Council; 
*   [Edinburgh Data Science](http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/data-science).


## Data Literacy


### Course Description

Data plays a pervasive role in modern society: we are all consumers
and producers of data on a daily basis. Moreover, data is increasingly
important for all aspects of academic endeavour.  By becoming data
literate—understanding how data is collected, how it can be
interpreted, and how it functions in social and political
processes—you will be better prepared for your undergraduate studies,
for your future career, and for becoming an informed citizen. This
course will provide you with basic concepts and tools for
understanding data, but just as importantly, it gives you an
opportunity to acquire a practice-based understanding of data by
contributing to a team-based interdisciplinary project.  Your team
will address an existing social challenge by collecting, processing
and analysing data as part of designing a solution.


### Summary of Intended Learning Outcomes

The learning outcomes build on the framework provided by [the SCQF Level Descriptors](http://scqf.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/SCQF-Revised-Level-Descriptors-Aug-2012-FINAL-web-version1.pdf), and in particular address the five 'characteristics' which are used as a reference point for learning outcomes and different levels of learning:

* Knowledge and understanding;
* Practice: Applied knowledge, skills and understanding;
* Generic cognitive skills;
* Communication, numeracy and ICT skills; and
* Autonomy, accountability and working with others.


Although there may appear to be a large number of learning outcomes, this is somewhat deceptive since they are designed to interlock and reinforce each other.

1.  Demonstrate a knowledge of different types of data, and how such data is collected.
2.  Demonstrate a knowledge of basic data analysis techniques.
3.  Demonstrate an understanding of the principles for communicating
    information that arises from data. 
4.  Demonstrate an understanding of the way that data accrues value in
    the context of modern society. 
5.  Demonstrate an understanding of the basic legal and ethical issues
    that arise from data collection and data use. 
6.  Carry out at least two forms of data collection in a manner that
    respects legal and ethical considerations. 
7.  Interpret and evaluate data relative to specific communication / policy objectives.
8.  Implement, evaluate and document a prototype 'intervention'
    relative to the interests and needs of a specified community of
    stakeholders. 
9.  Communicate the information in two or more datasets using
    appropriate analytic, presentation and visualisation techniques. 
10. Plan and implement a small group project, demonstrating an ability
    to work in an interdisciplinary team. 
11. Act in a professional manner in interactions with stakeholders and the public.

### Assessment Information


Written Examination: 0%  
Assessed Assignments: 75%  
Oral Presentation: 25%  

### Syllabus


*   Types of data, data formats and data collection methods
*   Basic statistical properties of data sets, data quality
*   Data transformation and data linkage
*   Ethical and legal aspects of data collection and publication
*   Data visualisation 
*   Using data to persuade, to inform and to support decision-making
*   Economic value of data

In order to make the course more scalable over time, we will develop a library of focussed, modular learning materials which will allow students to gain online access to more theoretical parts of the syllabus. 

Note that the syllabus does not overlap to any signficant extent with  [Informatics 1: Data and Analysis](https://blog.inf.ed.ac.uk/da15/about), one of the core courses that Informatics 1 students are required to take.

### Example Project Theme


Waste management is an important element in the University’s
sustainability strategy. The overarching priority is to reduce the
volume of waste overall, and within that, to reduce the proportion of
waste the goes to landfill. The University has adoped a number of
measures for reaching these objectives, but there is plenty of scope
for extending and improving them. Waste management can be analysed at
both the macro and the micro level. Take paper towels. How many in
total are purchased, how do they ‘flow’ and get aggregated through the
overall University waste collection system, where are they collected
by the external waste contractor and where do they eventually end up?
At the micro level, what influences the decision of an individual to
use a paper towel (or two, or three) to clean her coffee cup?

**Assignment 1**: In your team, carry out a lightning investigation into
some aspect of waste managment in the University over the course of a
single week. What data is available? What issues can you discover?
What new data might you collect to get a better picture of the current
situation. Your team will be expected to give a 10 minute
presentation, with slides, of your initial findings.

[not summatively assessed]

**Assignment 2**: On the basis your first lightning investigation, plan
and implement a small project in which your team designs an
‘intervention’ which would help address some problem of waste
management. In the course of your project, you will be expected to
collect new data in order to gain better insight into the problem. You
should analyse this new data, see how it can be combined with other
available data, and investigate whether what you have found can be
used to justify new ways of dealing with waste.

* You will produce an individual report which describes your project,
    explains your specific role in the work, and presents your team’s
    conclusions. The submission should include (a pointer to) all data
    that you have collected.
* You will contribute to a final project presentation, which will
    include slides and any accompaning materials.



## Background

This proposal follows on from a pilot in the Masters-level Design for
Informatics course last semester that implemented key ideas from the
Living Lab movement and from the Learning by Developing model of
pedagogy.  Students were provided with a grounding in basic data
concepts, and engaged in a 4-week project on the theme of Active
Travel in collaboration with Inverleith Neighbourhood Partnership. The
results of the pilot were disseminated in a workshop to University
colleagues from across the spectrum of subject areas. The workshop
demonstrated that there is considerable interest in, and support for,
this kind of teaching innovation from many parts of the University.

The pilot was the basis for a succesful bid to the Principal’s
Teaching Award Scheme, and this will provide financial support for the
applicants to consolidate and extend the methods and teaching
resources for future deployments of the approach to Design for
Informatics and potentially for other courses.
