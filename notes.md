The learning outcomes build on the framework provided by [the SCQF Level Descriptors](http://scqf.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/SCQF-Revised-Level-Descriptors-Aug-2012-FINAL-web-version1.pdf), and in particular address the five 'characteristics' which are used as a reference point for learning outcomes and different levels of learning:

* Knowledge and understanding;
* Practice: Applied knowledge, skills and understanding;
* Generic cognitive skills;
* Communication, numeracy and ICT skills; and
* Autonomy, accountability and working with others.


Although there may appear to be a large number of learning outcomes, this is somewhat deceptive since they are designed to interlock and reinforce each other.

SCQF states that “one credit point represents the amount of learning achieved through a notional 10 hours of learning time which includes everything a learner has to do to achieve the outcomes in a qualification including the assessment procedures” and therefore examinations and assessments have been included in the capture of scheduled learning activity.  It must be a scheduled timed activity to formally assess the learning outcomes of the course; most common examples will be the degree examination, other examples could be presentations, language oral or the time allocated to present and/or exhibit work for assessment.  Other forms of summative assessment which are completed in the students own time will be covered under “Directed Learning and Independent Learning Hours”.
